    "There are several reasons why NoSQL systems are better than SQL system while working with big data, one the book shared us It is about an example of how using a SQL system to collect data from a website you develop can be easy at the beginning but it gets harder each time your website gets bigger or rather more known by people, therefore, there is more data to be collected, and the example of the book also gives solution but the solutions start getting more complex and complex at a point where a human mistake in the system can make everything collapse and also since your data is divided into different databases a query get complex and the system is not anymore a generalized one. So if you will work with big data a NoSQL is the best and also I researched about other reasons why people are starting using NoSQL systems rather than SQL systems:\n",
    "* NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, basically, the database can handle more data by just adding more servers to the database\n",
    "* NoSQL databases have the ability to become larger and much more powerful\n",
    "* NoSQL seems to work better on both unstructured and unrelated data.\n",
    "* They have a dynamic schema\n",
    "* These databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage\n",
    "* Allows to save large data without dividing into different databases"

But actually, the low latency matters when you actually what that latency, so the actual property is to have a low latency when you require it\n",
    "* Scalability: The system can be adapted to work with larger data when is required \n",
    "* Generalization: The system can be applied in different fields and not only in a specific one. The system is not designed to only be used in one project \n",
    "* Extensibility: A new feature can be added without destroying or affecting negatively your system\n",
    "* Ad hoc queries: This one I didn't understand it at all, but it is like mining your data to find new discoveries\n",

    "When we think of causes of system failure, hardware faults quickly come to mind. Our first response is usually to add redundancy to the individual hardware components in order to reduce the failure rate of the system. This approach cannot completely prevent hardware problems from causing failures, but it is well understood and can often keep a machine running uninterrupted for years. Until recently, redundancy of hardware components was sufficient for most applications, since it makes total failure of a single machine fairly rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as you can restore a backup onto a new machine fairly quickly, the downtime in case of failure is not catastrophic in most applications. Thus, multi-machine redundancy was only required by a small number of applications for which high availability was absolutely essential. However, as data volumes and applications’ computing demands have increased, more applications have begun using larger numbers of machines, which proportionally increases the rate of hardware faults."

Such faults are harder to anticipate, and because they are correlated across nodes, they tend to cause many more system failures than uncorrelated hardware faults . A service that the system depends on that slows down, becomes unresponsive, or starts returning corrupted responses. Cascading failures, where a small fault in one component triggers a fault in another component, which in turn triggers further faults .\n",

    "Small software projects can have delightfully simple and expressive code, but as projects get larger, they often become very complex and difficult to understand. This complexity slows down everyone who needs to work on the system, further increasing the cost of maintenance. A software project mired in complexity is sometimes described as a big ball of mud. When complexity makes maintenance hard, budgets and schedules are often overrun.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, reducing complexity greatly improves the maintainability of software, and thus simplicity should be a key goal for the systems we build. One of the best tools we have for removing accidental complexity is abstraction. A good abstraction can hide a great deal of implementation detail behind a clean, simple-to-understand façade. A good abstraction can also be used for a wide range of different applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only is this reuse more efficient than reimplementing a similar thing multiple times, but it also leads to higher-quality software, as quality improvements in the abstracted component benefit all applications that use it. For example, high-level programming languages are abstractions that hide machine code, CPU registers, and syscalls. SQL is an abstraction that hides complex on-disk and in-memory data structures, concurrent requests from other clients, and inconsistencies after crashes. Throughout this book, we will keep our eyes open for good abstractions that allow us to extract parts of a large system into well-defined, reusable components."
